# Script Name: setup_can0.sh
#
# Description:
# This script configures the CAN0 (Controller Area Network) interface on a Linux
# system by creating a static network configuration file. It ensures safe setup
# by backing up any existing configuration and writing a new one with predefined
# parameters. The script must be run with root privileges.
#
# Functionality:
#   1. Verifies that the script is executed with elevated (root) privileges.
#   2. Checks for an existing CAN0 configuration file.
#   3. If found, backs up the original file to preserve previous settings.
#   4. Writes a new CAN0 configuration with:
#        - Static interface setup
#        - Bitrate of 500000
#        - TX queue length of 1024
#   5. Provides clear status messages for each step.
#
# Variables:
#   CAN_FILE     - Path to the CAN0 network configuration file.
#   BACKUP_FILE  - Path to store the backup of the original CAN0 configuration.
#
# Usage:
#   Run this script using sudo:
#     sudo ./setup_can0.sh
#
# Notes:
#   - Designed for Debian-based systems using /etc/network/interfaces.d/
#   - Requires root access to modify network configuration files.
